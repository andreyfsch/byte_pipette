# MetAp_EvoAnal
Methonine Aminopeptidase Evolutionary Analysis

In the initial part of this project, the aim is to download every sequence
from available DBs, filter them by similarities, generate single motif 
sequences and then promote alignments of each motif type separatedly as well 
as of alignments of the whole sequence.

Sequences will be retrieved from Uniprot utilizing the protein's name as a
query and HMMER utilizing M24 family pfam.
